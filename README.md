RANDOM KICKASS SCRIPTS
======================

This is just gonna be a bunch of useful UNIX scripts.

Expect a lot of text processing, flat file smashing, log cruising, dragon
slaying, killer scripts and one-liners. I'll also do some educational
stuff.

| Script                          | Description                                                                           |
| ---                             | ---                                                                                   |
| [Word Refactor](#word-refactor) | Simple refactoring script that replaces word strings, while cognizant of word endings |

Word Refactor
-------------

```bash
Â» echo  "its itsraining() [its] raining() rainginginging raining" | ./word_refactor.pl -m its=es -m raining=regnet
es itsraining() [es] regnet() rainginginging regnet
```
